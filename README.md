## RS2 UI Enhancement Mod

This mod aims to make the UI and some other features more like the original game and less like a phone game.
Included features:
* Font replacement for something sharper and closer to the SFC version.
* Combat UI arrangement more compact and closer to the SFC version.
* UI texture replacement using textures similar to the SFC version.
* Audio sliders for SFX and music separately as well as resolution settings.
* Options for the above settings can be accessed by pressing Home on the keyboard in-game or from the settings file in AppData\LocalLow\SquareEnix\RomancingSaGa2.
* Skill etc. descriptions display fully instead of scrolling (Not implemented yet).
* Speed toggle. Press R3 or PageDown to toggle between 1x, 2x and 3x speed. This option multiplies FPS. Field and battle speed multipliers are stored and loaded separately.
* You can also add your own texture replacements. Textures loaded by the game will show up in the Extract folder, so just copy the directory structure into ReplaceFile folder and add your edits.

Let me know if there are bugs.

### Install
You need to first install MelonLoader for Romancing SaGa 2 https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader  
Then get the RS2UIMod.zip from the releases page on the right, and extract the ReplaceFile, rs3font and Mods into the game folder (or compile the mod yourself with VS 2017)

### How it looks (for now)
